A work in progress application intended to be run on Android.

The remote is meant to scan the subnet for available rokus, this is a loud 'try to connect' to everything kinda deal. The discovery methods intended for roku use don't seem to be very stable for me under python.

You'll be able to control multiple rokus at the same time, I'm considering adding macros, etc.
